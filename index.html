    <p>'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p>

    <p>'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p>

    <p>'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p>

    <p>'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'</p>

    <p>As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,  to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good  thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the  number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p>

    <p>They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy  thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock  Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some  executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with  the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on  the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go  after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p>

    <p>The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till  she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,  half to itself, half to Alice.</p>

    <p>'What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p>

    <p>'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never  executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p>

    <p>'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly  after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'</p>

    <p>'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle  replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic&mdash;Ambition,  Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p>

    <p>'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'</p>

    <p>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of  uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'</p>

    <p>'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means&mdash;to&mdash;make&mdash;anything&mdash;prettier.'</p>

    <p>'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,  you ARE a simpleton.'</p>

    <p>Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she  turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'</p>

    <p>'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off  the subjects on his flappers, '&mdash;Mystery, ancient and modern, with  Seaography: then Drawling&mdash;the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,  that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and  Fainting in Coils.'</p>

    <p>'What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p>

    <p>'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too  stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p>

    <p>'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.'</p>

    <p>'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not  myself, you see.'</p>

    <p>'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

    <p>'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,  'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many  different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p>

    <p>'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

    <p>'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you  have to turn into a chrysalis&mdash;you will some day, you know&mdash;and then  after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little  queer, won't you?'</p>

    <p>'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

    <p>'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know  is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p>

    <p>'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'</p>

    <p>Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY  short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,  you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p>

    <p>'Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p>
